Line 6 creates a new function called mostFrequentWord and accepts the parameters (text) as an argument.
Line 7 creates a variable called words that accepts (text) from the output of getTokens. 
Line 8 produces an empty array called wordFrequencies.
Line 9 creates a for loop that sums up the words assosiated with getTokens. 
Linie 10 creates an if statement that says if there are words to add in wordFrequencies there will be a command.
Line 11 adds the words into wordFrequencies.
Line 12 has an else statement to do something else if there are no words to count. 
Line 13 gives the command to assighn 1 to the variable word if there is nothing else to count.
Line 14 and 15 close the for and if statements. 
Line 16 creates a variable currentMaxKey and assighns the Object.key method to it while accepting the paramenters 
of wordFrequencies and initializing it to zero.
Line 17 creates a array currentMaxCount is euqal to the value of wordFrequancies with its parameters made up of currentMaxKey.
Line 19 creates a for loop that finds the words in wordFrequencies. 
Line 20 creates an if statement that says if the word in wordFrequencies is greater tahn currentMaxCount do something. 
Line 21 adds the current word to currentMaxKey. 
Line 22 adds the word from word from wordFrequencies to currentMaxCount. 
Line 23 and 24 end the for and if loops. 
Line 25 returns the currentMaxKey to the main. 
A closing breaket closes the program on line 26
