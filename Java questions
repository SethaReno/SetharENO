Variable scope outlines which vriables will be accessed within a funtion and outside a functions parameters. Global scope is availabe in all
sets of code and all its variabls are defined outside of a function. Block scope is only available within its block function's intructions. 
Global variables should be avoided becasue they can be interchangeable and can produce mixed results due to incorrect values being placed in 
the wrong parameters. Java Script's 'strict mode' should be implemented at the top of every Java code page to ensure let or const are always 
perscribed to the designated variable's decleration. 
Side effects are funtions altering variabls outside of its own block and in the global scope. When dealing with uncontrolable side-effects 
and functions that manipulate global variables will be an almost certain recipe for inderminate code. Detriment code deals with pure function 
becasue it provides accurate values given accurate input. Pure function is just side-effect free detrimental code.
