Variable scope outlines which variables will be accessed within a funtion and outside a function's parameters. Global scope is availabe in all
sets of JavaScript code and all its variabls are defined outside of a function. Block scope is only available within its block function's intructions. 
Global variables should be avoided becasue they can be interchangeable and can produce mixed results due to incorrect values being placed in 
the wrong parameters. JavaScript's 'strict mode' should be implemented at the top of every JavaScript code page to ensure let or const are always 
perscribed to the designated variable's decleration. 
Side effects are funtions altering variabls outside of its own block and in the global scope. When dealing with uncontrolable side-effects 
and functions that manipulate global variables it will be an almost certain inderminate outcome in JavaScript code. Detriment code deals with pure function 
becasue it provides accurate values given accurate input. Pure function is just side-effect free detrimental JavaScript code.
